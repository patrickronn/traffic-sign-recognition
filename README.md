Group 30: Thien Nguyen, Justin Leong, Patrick Linang

This is a repository for the final project for ENEL 645 (Traffic sign recognition with Deep Learning)<br>
There are 4 notebooks for 4 different models developed for this project. If you have any problems previewing the notebook, please download it to see the notebook content in Jupyter or Google Colab.<br>
The 'content' folder includes the training and testing images used to develop the models.<br>
For the model results (model weight files), please refer to: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KwEqmOylFUUoai9_Leqk0xFINmzvx2J0?usp=sharing<br>
